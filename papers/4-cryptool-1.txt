At first, Alice and Bob agreed on the public parameters. So they chose a prime p and a generator g:

p: 47

g: 29

Alice chose her secret number 'a' while Bob chose his secret number 'b':

a: 16

b: 31

If the chosen secret values a and b are greater or equal the prime module p, then they need to be reduced modulo p. The actual values are given below:

a (reduced mod p):
16

b (reduced mod p):
31

On the basis of the previously chosen secret numbers, Alice and Bob created their respective shared keys. Alice computed her shared key A, while Bob computed his shared key B:

A: 8

B: 33

In order to calculate their secret and common Session Key, Alice and Bob exchanged their shared keys: Alice sent her shared key A to Bob and Bob sent his shared key B to Alice.

Alice and Bob were able to calculate the secret and common Session Key now. Alice computed the Session Key SA, Bob computed the Session Key SB:

SA: 2

SB: 2

Theoretically it is now possible for Alice and Bob to use their Session Keys to encrypt documents they would like to exchange covertly.
